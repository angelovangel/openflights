# openflights
A leaflet map with the openflights.org data

### How to use

```r
shiny::runGitHub("openflights", "angelovangel")
```

Or, download all the files from here and start `app.R` in RStudio.
The app should start in a browser, click on an airport and select airline(s) from the dropdown menu.
Note that this app is not intended for serious use, it is just me learning `leaflet` maps for `R`.
